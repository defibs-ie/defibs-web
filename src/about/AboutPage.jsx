            Automated external de足fibrillators (AEDs) are pretty handy.
            That's why we install them in the places where we work, shop, and socialize.
            They're like pizza cutters: when you need one, nothing else will do.
            It's a good idea to know where your nearest AED is,
            but they can be hard to find, especially when you need them the most.

          <Text>
            It seems like it would be a pretty good idea to have a map that you
            could look at on your smartphone to show you the nearest AED.
            So, with your help, we're making one.

            Nope, not at all. Information on this website is provided by
            helpful people on the Internet who agree that a map of Irish AEDs
            is a good idea. While we do our best to confirm the information
            we're given, AEDs are sometimes stolen, de足commissioned, or simply
            left to deteriorate without our knowledge.

              It's your responsibility to know where your nearest AED is when
              you're at home, at work, or elswhere.  If we can help, we're
              happy.

            We wanted it, and it wasn't there. Now it is.
            We've done more pointless things in our lives, believe us.

            Very likely. Would you like to fix that?  If you have a smartphone
